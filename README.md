# Learning
This repository is a personal portfolio of projects focused on learning and applying new programming techniques, machine learning concepts, and mathematical models. Each project explores a different area of data science or machine learning, with an emphasis on hands-on implementation and understanding the theory behind the models.
Projects Include:
1. Movie Sentiment Analyzer
    Built a text classification pipeline using scikit-learn and PyTorch to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Explored feature engineering, neural networks, and performance evaluation.
2. Weather Predictor
    Implemented a multilayer perceptron (MLP) from scratch using only NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy to predict weather conditions from time-series data. Focused on core MLP mechanics and regularization techniques.
3. Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
    Developed a two-state HMM from scratch and implemented the forward-backward and Baum-Welch algorithms to uncover hidden states and model parameters from observed emission sequences.
